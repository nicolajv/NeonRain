* [[Mech]] skylder ham en tjeneste

The name's [[Ace]], and my life's been a wild ride dealt straight from a deck of cards. Born in the depths of [[Seattle]]'s underbelly to a pair of gamblers who lived and breathed poker, I was practically raised at the poker table. I could shuffle before I could talk, and by the time I hit my teens, I was running bluffs better than most could run a mile.

Life in the slums was no cakewalk, but poker? That was my sanctuary. My skills got sharp, real sharp, and before I knew it, I was the kid making waves in the underground poker scene. But that was just the beginning. [[Horizon]] saw something in me, a spark, a flair for the dramatic. And just like that, I was plucked from the back alleys and thrown under the glitzy lights of the big stage.

World Series of Poker? Conquered it. I became a household name, the face of Horizon's latest and greatest poker extravaganza. My mug was on billboards, my story was on every trid show. I was the poker prodigy, living every gambler's dream.

But you know what they say about flying too close to the sun. It all came crashing down one fateful night at a high-stakes game. The chips were down, the crowd was roaring, and the cards were flying. That's when I felt the sting of betrayal. A setup, a scheme so elaborate it could only be orchestrated by someone on the inside. My inside.

I lost everything that night—my reputation, my winnings, my status. [[Horizon]] cut ties quicker than a bad bluff, and I was left with nothing but the clothes on my back and a burning desire for revenge.

So here I am, a former poker star turned [[Shadowrunner]], navigating the murky waters of the underworld with a deck of cards in one hand and a grudge in the other. The stakes? Higher than ever. The risks? Just the way I like them. But this time, I'm playing for keeps.

They say in poker, you've got to play the hand you’re dealt. Well, I was dealt a royal flush only to have it snatched away. Now, I'm back at square one, with the deck stacked against me and a short stack in my hand. Time to see if I've still got that old [[Ace]] magic.
