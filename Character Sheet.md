## Qualities

### SINner (Negative)

Unlike a lot of runners, who have either no SIN or a criminal SIN, you have a legitimate SIN that links back to biometric data. You have enough attachment to it, whether for your own or family purposes, that you can’t just burn it.

- Game Effect:
    - You pay taxes to the issuer of your SIN, either a megacorporation or a nation. This cost comes as a 10 percent in- crease in the cost of the lifestyle associated with this SIN.
    - Due to data within the Global SIN Regis- try, you are easier to track or identify, giving opponents a point of Edge every time they attempt a Trace Icon action against you.

### Trust Issues (Negative)

You’ve been burned too many times and are always watching closely for signs of betrayal.

- Game Effect:
    - You may not gain or spend Edge on any Influence (Etiquette or Negotiation) and Judge Intentions test. None of your contacts may have a Loyalty rating higher than 3. If you join a magical group, your maximum Loyalty is 3.

### Analytical Mind (Positive)

You are a master problem solver. You can analyze information to help deduce solutions, while separating useful bits from the distractions and noise.

- Game Effect:
    - You gain a bonus Edge when you make any Logic-based test.

### Exceptional (Logic) (Positive)

Whether it’s being a powerhouse, taking a hit from a troll, holding your synthahol, ducking a fast right, holding that inside turn, selling coal in Newcastle, or making a cat look clumsy, you’re just naturally built to be better.

- Game Effect:
    - Select a Physical or Mental at- tribute. That attribute's maximum (but not current) rank increases by 1. This quality can only be purchased once per attribute.

### Aptitude (Cracking) (Positive)

The best look up to you. You have the natural potential to be even better than the best in a particular skill.

- Game Effect:
    - Your skill maximum for the selected skill is 10, instead of 9, and your maximum starting rank is 7, instead of 6.

### Brilliant Heuristics (Positive)

You have a special knack for efficiently focusing your processing power

- Game Effect:
    - If you spend a Minor Action to prepare and calibrate your available processing power immediately before taking a Matrix Action, add half your Data Processing attribute (round up) as bonus dice on the test. If you do not immediately take a Matrix Action after doing this, the bonus is lost. This quality may only be used by a persona running on a cyberdeck.

### Surgical Strike (Positive)

You have a talent for subtly hacking into hosts.

- Game Effect:
    - The Overwatch Score increase from having illegal user or admin access to a host occurs once per minute instead of once per combat round.

## Contacts

### Tess "Wildcard" Rodriguez

- Connection 1
- Loyalty 3

Tess, known in the poker circles as “Wildcard” for her unpredictable playstyle, is still a prominent figure in the professional poker scene. She and Ace shared many tables, intense moments, and even a mutual respect for each other's skills. When the scandal around Ace broke out, Tess was among the few who publicly doubted the accusations, though it created a rift between her and some of the poker community. Today, while she still competes at the highest levels, she maintains a clandestine connection with Ace, keeping him informed about the poker world's whispers and rumors.

### Jamie “The Signal” Turner

- Connection 3
- Loyalty 1

Jamie is a rising star in Horizon’s Public Relations department, known for her knack for turning situations to the corporation’s advantage with minimal resources. She became acquainted with Ace during his poker days, as she was part of the team responsible for promoting poker events and the stars playing in them. When the scandal broke out, Jamie was among the few who suspected that Ace might have been framed, but she lacked the power and resources to do anything about it at the time.

### [[Frank “Eagle Eye” Thompson]]

- Connection 2
- Loyalty 2

Frank was a popular commentator for poker tournaments, known for his sharp observations and witty commentary. After the scandal, he grew skeptical of the mega-corporations’ influence in sports and entertainment and became an investigative journalist. He has kept in touch with Ace, sharing a mutual interest in uncovering the truth.

### Programs

### Agent (rating 6)

An agent program's Charisma, Intuition, Logic, and Willpower attributes are all equal to its rating.
An agent also has a number of ranks in the Cracking and Electronics skills equal to its rating. The Matrix attributes of an agent come from the hacker's devices and are exactly the same as the cyberdeck's persona (including any bonuses or penalties from software, hardware, complex forms, etc.). An agent does not normally have a Matrix condition monitor of its own –if it takes Matrix damage, that damage goes straight to the cyberdeck's condition monitor. If an agent's actions generate overwatch, it applies to the parent device's overwatch score. Agent software shares all user and admin access statuses with its parent device, and it only has access to any devices or files that are explicitly allowed.

An agent's Matrix initiative is (rating x 2) + 2D6. Any Matrix initiative enhancements from a cyberjack or other source also improve the agent's initiative. Unlike PA apps, agents are not limited to legal Matrix actions. They will take any Matrix action that is required in order to carry out their orders with no regard for legality or ethics.

One of the most common uses for an agent is to provide assistance to a decker. Unless commanded to do otherwise, an agent will always make a Teamwork test on behalf of all of its owner's Matrix actions. When used in this way, the agent must buy hits instead of rolling dice, providing one hit for every four dice (rounded down). To save time, note how many hits your agent can buy, and don't forget to add that many bonus dice to your dice pools when you take a Matrix Action. Note that each teamwork assistance requires your agent to take a Major Action, so its uses may be limited when time is of the essence.

Agents can access and use any program that is also running on their parent device. Some programs have been specifically designed to enhance agents. Autosofts were originally designed to provide drones with additional skills, and skillsofts to work with skillwire augmentations, but the Autosoft Host program allows an agent to make use of them, too. If you are running an Autosoft Host, you can load additional autosofts and skillsofts in your other program slots. Your agent gains the skills provided by the sofrware. An agent can only run them at a rating up to its own rating, but it can effectively run a more powerful autosoft or skillsoft at a lower rating in order to make it compatible. Note that an agent already has the Cracking and Electronics skills. Agents can provide teamwork assistance with any skill they have access to.

Many hackers prefer to code their own agents, but they can be legally purchased with a special license.
